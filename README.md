# FanControl
Fan control software based on "Netbook FanControl" which didn't work for my CPU.

This is experimental and you can mess stuff up if you use this.

Doesn't support CPU temperature stuff yet, only has a slider for fan speed.

You will need to type in your own fan byte location which can be found according to Netbook FanControl's user guide using RW Everything.
